             &hearts; This model can be seen as a combination between the autoregressive and the mean-based
             mean-based smoothing approaches. We will learn how to make estimates for the
             parameters, the selection of submodels based on information criteria and
             prediction.

            <h4><p>
             &hearts; Spectral estimation in statistics and signal processing 
             can be understood as an algorithm that estimates the strength of 
             the different frequency components (the power spectrum) of a signal in 
             the time domain. We often refer to this as frequency domain analysis.

         fulfill? SARIMA is one possible solution.
