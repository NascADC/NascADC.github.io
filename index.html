[Statistics] "... Statistics is the study of how to deal with data by mean of probability models.... The statistician looks on probability as an idealisation of the proportion of times that a certain result will occur in repeated trials of an experiment ... The object of Statistics is information. The objective of Statistics is the understanding of information contained in data." 
(p. 3, [Vic Barnett, Comparative Statistical Inference, Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics]) 
</p>
<p>
[Principle of parsimony] " In choosing a model, we shall attempt to adhere to the principle of parsimony; that is, the model used should require the smallest number of parameters that will adequately represent the time series. Albert Einstein is quoted in Parzen (1982, p. 68) as remarking that 'everything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler'."
(p. 8, [Cryer and Chan, Time Series with application in R])
